        <h2>Hey there!</h2>
        <br />
        <h4>I am Lukas Staub, a web-developer based in Germany.</h4>
        <br />
        <p>
            My main programming interests are in Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and ReactJS. It is my goal to create beautiful, responsive and amazing products,
            <br />
            with the main focus being an incredible and delightful User Experience.
            <br />
            In my opinion, the User is the main focus in every modern Web-Application, as it should be accessible and easy to use for everyone.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>I am not only able to create beautiful and amazing Web-Experiences, but mobile experience too, with the help of React Native.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Please take a look at my <a href="/projects">Projects page</a> for more information about my projects and what I am currently working on.</p>
        <br />
        <p>If you have any questions or are interested in my work, feel free to get in touch with me through my <a href="/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
